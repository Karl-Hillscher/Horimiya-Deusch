                    <p style="font-size:0.8vw;" style="float:left">The lively student Kyōko Hori (堀京子) is popular in her class and is always made up and dressed up.<br>
                        At home, however, she has to take care of the household and her brother Sōta (創太) because their parents work late.<br>
                        Here she dresses simply and doesn't want her friends to see her like that.<br>
                        But when one day her classmate Izumi Miyamura (宮村 伊澄) brings her brother (Sōta) home because he was injured, he learns Hori's secret.<br>
                        But Miyamura also surprises her, because the shy outsider from school is unexpectedly pierced and in punk clothes in front of her.<br>
                        Both want to keep each other's secrets, but soon spend more and more time together.<br>
                        After they have always hidden part of their personality from others, the mutual openness is good for them.<br>
                        Miyamura also finds more self-confidence and friends. Eventually, Hori and Miyamura fall in love and become a couple.</p></div>

            <p class="w3-container w3-margin-right">Kyouko is a tall and slim girl who is known to be cute and pretty by most of her classmates with mid-back length chestnut-brown hair that is usually tied up <br>(whenever she is outside of school or in a casual setting) with bangs swept to the right side and golden-brown eyes.</p>
            <p>Kyouko is normally a very energetic and popular person who always creates a happy atmosphere around herself. She is a hard worker in all aspects of her life,<br> and, according to Izumi Miyamura, she scores above 90% for all her tests. When nervous or embarrassed,<br> she tends to switch to a violent state. This is seen when Kyousuke Hori asks if Miyamura was her boyfriend, resulting in her turning red and shoving a hot ladle into his face.</p>

He also has a few dark-colored tattoos on his left shoulder, upper left arm and side.</p>
            <p>Initially at school, Izumi gives off the impression of a quiet, gloomy and anti-social person. His classmates' perception of him is that he is an otaku with good studying capabilities,<br> but a hard person to approach and maintain a conversation with.</p>

Due to her attachment to Hori, she often gets angry when Hori is together with Izumi Miyamura, choosing to push him away.<br> She views Miyamura as a rival, but also as a brotherly figure. She was very close to her older brother who passed away some years ago. She appears to have mild androphobia, often freezing up,<br> running away, or hiding when approached by men.
